# Selection Sort
### Implemented with JavaScript
selection sort is a sorting algorithm that places smaller values at a sorted position.

**Algorithm for selection sort using natural language**
***
1. Store the first element as the smallest value that you have seen so far in the array.
2. Keep comparing this item to the next item until you find the smallest item than what you have as the smallest so far.
3. Swap the two values, i.e the smallest value currently and what you have found as the smallest in step 3.
4. Repeat this with the next element from step 2 until the whole array is sorted.

The big o of selection sort is O(n2)
